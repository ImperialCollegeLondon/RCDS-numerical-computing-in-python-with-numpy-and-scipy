    "# Initial Value Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Value Problems are a common type of problem encountered when simulating a physical system's progression with time. Given a series of initial values, a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are solved to solve the progression of the system. For instance, the rate of change of the number of bacteria $N(t)$ in a growth medium might be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\textrm{d}N(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = \\alpha N(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a growth rate. If there are initially 10 bacteria at $t=0$, the number of bacteria as a function of time can be solved as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$N(t)=10e^{\\alpha t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This example could be solved analytically, but other systems of equations are more complex. In this case, SciPy's ```scipy.integrate.solve_ivp``` function ([manual page](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)) can be very useful for calculating the evolution of a physical system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scipy.integrate.solve_ivp``` can solve the time-progression of a collection of values, presented as a vector. The function requires another function be passed to it which describes the system of equations which give the derivative as a function of the values passed to it and the current time of the system as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also takes the initial value of the system (as an array) and an array of times for which the values of the equations to be solved for are to be found. It may optionally take a tuple of values which will be passed as arguments to the function which calculates the derivative. This means the values used in the derivative function don't need to be hard-coded in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll consider the [Lorenz system of equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system), which arises in simplified models of a number of physical systems including lasers, electric circuits and chemical reactions. The system of equations governing the derivative of its three variables ($x$, $y$ and $z$) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\frac{\\textrm{d}x(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = \\sigma(y - x)\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\textrm{d}y(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = x(\\rho - z) - y\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\textrm{d}z(t)}{\\textrm{d}t} = xy - \\beta z\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are solving for three variables as a function of time, the arrays which hold the state of the system at a particular time (or the rate of change of the system at a particular time) will be one-dimensional arrays with a size of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta$, $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$ are parameters which define the behaviour of the system. By picking values of 10, 8/3 and 28, we make the system  chaotic, which means we expect some interesting results.\n"
