    "However, this function becomes slower and slower as the size of matrix gets larger. For a particular type of matrix that contains mostly zeros, this can be sped up by storing the matrix as a sparse matrix. This means that only non-zero values will be stored and only these non-zero values will be used in calculations. This dramatically reduces memory usage and the computational cost of the solving the matrix equation. There are may [types of sparse matrix included in SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html), but we will pick the [compressed row storage matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.csr_matrix) for this example (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_(CSR,_CRS_or_Yale_format) ) for a rough description of how this works). The matrix we will solve for will have the value of 1 along the central diagonal and -0.5 on the adjacent diagonals. The array on the left-hand side will have a value of 1.\n",

    "There are [many solvers](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html) included to be used with sparse matrices. Which one to use is not always a simple question.
