    "# Built-In Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "```scipy.special``` contains a number of built in functions that may be useful for different applications. A summary of these can be found [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/special.html). There are a few reasons you might choose to use the SciPy versions:\n",
    "* You don't have to spend time writing it yourself\n",
    "* The SciPy version will be well-tested and robust\n",
    "* The Scipy version will work element-wise on arrays of data \n",
    "* The SciPy version will be faster to run than what you could write yourself, particularly when operating on arrays of values\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the functions in ```scipy.special``` may be applied element-wise to NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of variation in the functions available in ```scipy.special```  and it's impossible to cover them all. Instead, this notebook runs through some examples that may be useful in themselves, but also aims to demonstrate the types of functions and interfaces which are available."

The magnitude of the order of the function must be less than or equal to the degree of the function and the degree of the function must be zero or greater.\n",

The function will accept complex values and may give complex answers."
